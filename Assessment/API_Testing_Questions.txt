API testing
1. Basics of API, purpose and structure
2. Common methods of API and common tools (postman, RestAssured, Curl)
3. Types of API testing - Functional, performance, security and compatibility 
4. An API is returning a 500 Internal server error. How would you debug this issue
    - [ ] Verify issue persists
    - [ ] Verify if API works with different inputs
    - [ ] If there is access to logs then verify Stack traces or database errors
    - [ ] Verify API in different environments (QA, Staging and Production)
    - [ ] Discuss with development team to debug further
5. How to test REST, SOAP APIs and how to handle JSON and CML responses
6. Best practices for API testing - refer testing pyramid- shiftleft
7. Challenges faced and overcome
8. How do you handle dynamic values in API responses like timestamps, session tokens etc
    - [ ] Extract the dynamic values using JSONPath or XPath instead of hardcoding
    - [ ] If the API returns timestamp, I’d compare it within a valid time range rather than an exact match
    - [ ] For session tokens, I’d store them in variables in postman or my automation framework to reuse in subsequent requests
9. How would you test API security vulnerabilities 
    - [ ] Perform access tests by removing auth headers
    - [ ] Test SQL injection by sending SQL commands in input fields
    - [ ] Check for sensitive data exposure by analyzing API responses for info like password or API Keys
    - [ ] Validate API against Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
10. How do you test API that processes large amounts of data?
    - [ ] Send large payloads 
    - [ ] Test for timeout issues when processing big datasets
    - [ ] Analyze memory usage and potential server crashes using tools like JMeter 
    - [ ] Check if data processing completes within the expected time and verify data integrity
