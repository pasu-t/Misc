What are the Bit rates defined in GPON?
	GPON aims at transmission speeds greater than or equal to 1.2 Gbit/s. Accordingly, GPON identifies two transmission speed combinations as follows −

	1.2 Gbps up, 2.4 Gbps down
	2.4 Gbps up, 2.4 Gbps down
	The most important bit rate is 1.2 Gbps up, 2.4 Gbps down, constituting nearly all of the deployed and planned deployment of the GPON systems
