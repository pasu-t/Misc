who creates persistant volumes and when?
	k8s Admin setsup and maintains the cluster
	k8s User deploys applications in cluster
	Admin provisions storage resource
	User creates claim to PV, no need to worry about where actually data is stored, all he wants is data is safely stored

-> pod requests the volume through pvc
-> claims tries to find a volume in cluster
-> claims must be in the same namespace


local volume types violates 
	not being tied to each specific node
	surviving cluster crashes

ConfigMap and Secret are local volumes and not created via PV and PVC

Storage Class(3rd part k8s component):
	abstracts underlying storage provider and parameters for that storage
	SC provisions persistent volumes dynamically when pvc claims it
	StorageBackend is defined in the SC component via provisioner attribute
	each storage backend has own provisioner
	internal provisioner - "kubernetes.io"
