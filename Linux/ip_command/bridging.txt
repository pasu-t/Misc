Basic link manipulation
To create a bridge named br0, that have eth0 and eth1 as members:

ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set dev br0 up
ip link set dev eth0 master br0
ip link set dev eth1 master br0
To remove an interface from the bridge:

ip link set dev eth0 nomaster
And finally, to destroy a bridge after no interface is member:

ip link del br0

ip link | grep "master br0"
