gzip: the default compression used by tar via (-z), a good balance of speed and reduction
tar czf archive.tar file*
bzip2: an alternative, typically slower than gzip to higher compressions(large videos,audios)
tar cjf archive.tgz file*
zip: algorithm used by zip cmd, all-in-one and popular in other OS's
zip -r archive.zip file*
# to create a tarball of the ~/Practice folder named archive.tar:
tar cvf archive.tar Practice/

# to add the file ~/extra.txt to the existing tarball:
tar rf archive.tar extra.txt

# Now create another tarball, but this time, compress it during creation 
tar czf archive.tgz Practice/

# Use the gzip utility to compress the first tarball (archive.tar) with maximum compression:
gzip -9 archive.tar
This will compress the file and rename it archive.tar.gz.

# to extract the file Practice/Test/version.txt from the compressed archive archive.tar.gz:
tar xzf archive.tar.gz Practice/Test/version.txt
# This will extract the file to the existing path and overwrite the file if it exists.
