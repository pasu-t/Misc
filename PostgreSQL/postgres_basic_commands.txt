Some basic examples:

	earthquake_id int,
	occurred_on timestamp without time zone,
	latitude numeric,
	longitude numeric,

	magnitude numeric,

	network_id varchar,
	place varchar,
	cause varchar)

SELECT * FROM earthquake;
COPY PUBLIC."earthquake" from 'C:\workspace\myTools\PostgreSQL\earthquake.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
SELECT * FROM earthquake;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM earthquake;
SELECT magnitude,place,occurred_on FROM earthquake;

SELECT *
FROM earthquake
WHERE occurred_on >= '2000-01-01';

SELECT *
FROM earthquake
WHERE occurred_on >= '2010-01-01' AND occurred_on <= '2010-12-31'
ORDER BY magnitude DESC
LIMIT 1

SELECT column1, column2,...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1 AND condition2
ORDER BY column (ASC | DESC)
LIMIT n;

SELECT MIN(occurred_on), MAX(occurred_on)
FROM earthquake;

SELECT MIN(magnitude), MAX(magnitude)

SELECT cause

SELECT COUNT(*)

WHERE cause = 'nuclear explosion'
ORDER BY occurred_on DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT place,magnitude,occurred_on

LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM earthquake
WHERE place LIKE '%Honshu%Japan%'
    AND occurred_on BETWEEN '2011-03-11' AND '2011-03-18';
