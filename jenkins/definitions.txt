Jenkins:
-> jenkins is an Open Source java application.
-> It is an automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks like building, testing and deployment.

pipeline : 
-> Instead of building several jobs for each phase, you can now code the entire workflow and put it in a jenkinsfile
-> is a workflow with a group of events or jobs that are chained and integrated with each other in sequence
-> Every job in a pipeline has some dependancy on one or more other jobs
-> every pipe will have inlet and outlet. Pipeline consists of multiple sections of a pipe and also it can have multiple inlets and outlet.
-> Two types
    -> Scripted pipeline: Traditional way of writing the code. 
                        Code is written on the Jenkins UI instance
					    Code is defined within pipeline block
					    It is a user definde block which contains all the stages

    -> Declarative pipeline: Recent feature. 
                         Simpler groovy syntax. 
						 Code is written locally and is checked into VCS.
						 Code is defined within node block
						 A node is machine that executes the entire workflow 
						 
 -> Agent: instructs jenkins to allocate an executor for the builds.It is defined for entire pipeline or specific stage
